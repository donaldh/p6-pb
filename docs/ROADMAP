The Perl 6 Protocol Buffers project is currently still in the early stages:
it can successfully parse a valid `.proto` file into an AST (and does so for
Google's official `.proto` test files), but there is much more to be done
before a first release.  In no particular order:

* Generate classes for in-memory management of message data
* Encode and decode binary PBs
* Parse and emit text PBs
* Parse RPC service declarations
* Wire up all pieces into a cohesive API
* Lots more testing
* Docs: API, Perl 6-specific quirks, etc.
